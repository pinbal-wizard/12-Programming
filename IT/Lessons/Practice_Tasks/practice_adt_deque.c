/*
	Implement your deque ADT here. Read the associated header file first!

	A basic test program is provided for you to check your code, but you should
	add to the tests if you feel they do not go far enough. During marking,
	your ADT will be marked with a more extensive testing program. Your code
	will also be read manually for aspects such as coding style.

	This is a practice question. There is no need to submit your response to Google Classroom.
	Avoid the use of any inbuilt library code. Aim to write original code only.
