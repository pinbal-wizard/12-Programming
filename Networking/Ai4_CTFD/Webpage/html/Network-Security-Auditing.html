        <h2>Our Network Security Auditing Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    During the assessment phase, we thoroughly examine your network architecture and configuration,
                    analyzing various components such as firewalls, routers, switches, and access points.
                    This assessment helps us understand the overall network layout and potential points of vulnerability.
